Building software to build amazing buildings!

So over the past 4 years I've been developing our in-house robotics software on top of PythonOCC. I'd love to talk about how PythonOCC is a great platform to take part in changing the building industry. here's a recent article [1] we're wrapping up the new HQ for Lego [2]

I think it would be cool to speak about the parallel of building pythonocc vs setting up a company that explores its potential. this is known for web technologies, but to a lesser extent in robotics / CAD / BIM
