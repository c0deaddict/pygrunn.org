:title: Advanced REST API's
:fulltitle: Advanced REST API's

Designing REST API's is hard. It is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike anything else we normally design. Object oriented ideas are not sufficient here, nor will a functional approach fit. You are limited to the HTTP verbs, but you shouldn't always limit yourself to CRUD. You should be able to navigate, but there is no standard such as HTML for API's, so how does this work?

In this talk we'll talk about how to design a RESTful API. We'll have a quick look at what REST is and what it tries to accomplish. We then talk about designing the process your API needs to support and the data/resources it needs. We look at media types for (amongst other things) navigation, and the balance between discoverability and documentation. And, if we have time, we will consider some more extended topics such as change management, rate limiting and cache policies.
