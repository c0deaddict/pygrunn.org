:fulltitle: Morepath: Under The Hood

Morepath is a web framework with some interesting technologies under the hood.  In particular this talk is for you if:

* You already use a Python web framework and are curious about how they work.
* You actually work on another web framework yourself and are curious about how they could work better.
* You work on some non web framework and you want to learn about some new approaches.
* Strangely enough you actually use Morepath and are curious about how it works.
