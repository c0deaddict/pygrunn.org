:fulltitle: Creating a high performance server in python

Most used languages for building adservers like c/c++/java, while having great running performance, have a higher development cost. We can build the ad-server in python making it efficient enough by using many c extensions, and if it succeeds the project will have the funds to be rebuilt in a more efficient language. Most of the modules used are python wrappers of c extensions, making it easier to translate the program in a more efficient language like c/c++.
