:fulltitle: Extending C programs with PyPy-powered code

One of the most significant contributions that the PyPy developers have brought to the Python ecosystem is the cffi package. Now with the recent release of PyPy 5 it becomes possible to use cffi to embed PyPy into a C program. This means you can extend existing non-Python software with blazingly fast Python code.

In this talk Emil Loer will show you how you can use this technique to write a PyPy-powered plugin for an existing piece of software written in C. Along the road he will explain how cffi works and what makes it so great.
