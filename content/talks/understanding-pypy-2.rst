:fulltitle: Understanding PyPy and using it in production

In this presentation Bart and Peter from Paylogic will talk about the PyPy Python interpreter and JIT compiler. We’ll explain what it is, how it works and when to use it. The presentation starts with a high level introduction and then moves on to discuss some of the foundations and internals. After that we take a look at how Paylogic switched one of its production systems to PyPy and quadrupled the performance. Finally we’ll try to give you some guidelines to help you decide which of your projects can benefit from switching to PyPy.
