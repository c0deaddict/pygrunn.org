:title: Elasticsearch for SQL users
:fulltitle: Elasticsearch for SQL users

Most developers are familiar with relational databases and its query language, SQL. We know how to model our data so it can fit the relational paradigm and we know how to query this relational data using SQL.

Elasticsearch is a document store with its own query DSL. In this talk we will look at several well-understood concepts and SQL queries from the relational paradigm and map these to their Elasticsearch equivalents. Using a concrete example, we will discuss possible data models and their implications to query speeds and indexing. Last we will talk about the Aggregation framework of Elasticsearch. Next be a powerful source of insights and analytics, it can be a surprising tool to do SQL like joins.

If you are someone with a solid grasp of the relational world and looking to map your mental model to the document-oriented search world, this talk is for you!
