Python is no stranger to asynchronous I/O. Twisted has been around for more than a decade, and Tornado is approaching its 5th birthday.

At Layar, we use both. So, when Guido announced what would become the asyncio library (or Tulip, its reference implementation), we were naturally curious. It has now been incorporated into the standard library with the 3.4 release a few weeks ago, so it's about time to get our hands dirty.

This talk is a first look at asyncio. It won't contain all the answers, but hopefully some (and raise interesting questions).
