:fulltitle: Dangers of centralization. Options and solutions.

Recent issues, e.g. with NSA, has shown that centralized systems and data bring along considerable dangers. Whether it's privacy, security, reliability, safety, etc. With an increasing dependance on these systems the risks increase accordingly. The problem is not unique to large IT systems but can be seen at many levels and in many settings. The world is riddled by problems caused by centralization. It seems that nobody or nothing can really handle the power that centralized systems give them.

But there is a way out. Nature for instance has shown that in many domains only decentralized systems work. But there are examples from a wide range of other domains, e.g. economy, IT, society, etc. Decentralized systems have their own problems, of course, but it could solve some of our pressing current day issues.

This raises many questions and it is important to address them. For example, if you can solve issues in software systems by building them with an inherent drive towards decentralization, could you translate such a solution to other domains? And looking at IT specifically, what are the alternatives to centralized systems? Will they work? What are the available tools for building decentralized systems?

This panel session will start with a presentation about the problem domain followed by an open discussion between the panel and the audience. Being a technology conference the focus of the discussion will be software systems.

This panel session marks the kickoff of a larger project on this topic. Details of the larger project will be touched upon during the session.

Everybody is encouraged to actively participate!
