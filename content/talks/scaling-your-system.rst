:title: Scaling your system
:fulltitle: Scaling your system

You have a system running in a bunch of servers with a centralized database. It works and you like it but your customers like it even more. In fact, they like it so much that your metal barely keeps up with all the traffic, data, users and love. Either you find a way to scale your system (the Instagram way) or you make it uglier to scare users away (the Digg way). At Paylogic we prefer the former.

We'll look at basic scalability patterns, what we should look to decide how to scale and at how others did it, and we'll apply all this to an imaginary monolythic system.
