:fulltitle: Growing Open Source Seeds & Documentation is King


The 'Growing Open Source Seeds' talk will be an in-depth review of the stages that most open source projects go though, and the decisions their maintainers face. Requests will be used as an example — lessons learned and best practices will be covered.


Open source is all about communication — a project is only as useful as the documentation is has. This is why Kenneth gives a second talk called 'Documentation is King'.

Every design decision should be documented. Imagine not having to have tap your coworkers on the shoulder when you’re working on an unfamiliar part of the codebase, or on-boarding a new employee. Imagine being able to make the change, run the tests, and push to production without questioning yourself, because the process was documented — or better yet, automated.
