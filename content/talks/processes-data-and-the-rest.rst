:fulltitle: Processes, Data and the rest

The systems we build are complicated. They have to support complicated processes, such as configuring events, selling complicated product and dealing with financial aspects. They also generate and use lots of complicated data. It is not easy to design such systems, making sure that all processes are supported and that all data is taken into account.

The talk introduces a systematic way to create such designs. I will also sketch how that method can be used to create restful API's. The method helps us to build scalable API's that not just allow clients to use data but also make it easy to support complicated processes.
