:title: Keynote: Writing idiomatic Python
:fulltitle: Writing Idiomatic Python: Towards Comprehensible and Maintainable Code

This talk explores the notion of what makes Python code idiomatic (or "Pythonic"). 
It discusses what idiomatic code is, examples of how to write in an idiomatic style, 
and the benefits of doing so. 
Primarily through sample code, you'll learn how NOT to write code to solve common issues, 
as well as the idiomatic way to accomplish the same thing. 
As a result, your code will be more readable, easier to maintain, and easier to test.
