:title: Reliable distributed task scheduling
:fulltitle: Reliable distributed task scheduling

At Paylogic, we wanted a task queue to handle workloads that are too heavy to handle in the request-response cycle. We considered several ""off the shelf"" solutions, but none met our requirements. Given this, we decided to build our own (in Python).

This talk will first discuss the off the shelf solutions we considered and the reasons why we eventually decided to build our own solution. The second part will discuss this solution in depth (architecture, set-up, use cases etc.).
