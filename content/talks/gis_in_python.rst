:fulltitle: GIS in Python. Solutions and architecture trade-offs

Python has become the de-factor language in GIS frameworks and applications, both in open source and in proprietary solutions. We’ll shortly introduce GIS concepts and an overview of these geospatial python solutions.

We’ll dive into specific python solutions to process and present vector and raster data in farming applications. Like in other domains, there’s an interesting trade-off between processing data in the database, web server or in-browser. We’ll explore how processing GIS data on different layers impact usability, interactivity and performance.
