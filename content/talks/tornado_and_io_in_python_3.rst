:fulltitle: Tornado and IO in Python 3

Tornado reflects most of its strength while implementing small
web-services. Its IO loop approach let you work efficiently while
doing lot of interaction with the network, other processes or
working with large files. Using those technologies, this talk
will go over the implementation designs for our services we
choose with at Minddistrict in order to decouple our code-base.
