:fulltitle: Hello, Machine Learning!

Many big companies such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are investing a lot of time and resources in machine learning. Recognizing cats in video’s, people in photographs, topics in texts, words in audio; it’s all the fruits of machine learning.

If you’re a Pythonista and want to learn what machine learning is all about, you’re in luck! There are many good libraries, both for doing R&D, and for running machine learning applications in production.

In this talk I will demonstrate how to train a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits. It’s the “hello, world” of machine learning, and surprisingly simple: the model will not be more than 10 lines of code!
