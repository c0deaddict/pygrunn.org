How we use the Django-Oscar ecommerce platform to sell online tickets for a large park.

This will be a combined introduction / use case talk for most listeners. I shall introduce Oscar, and its possibilities.  An important role is for django-oscar-api, which is based on Django RESTApi, and exposes Oscar's content through an API.

I plan to discuss the requirements to Oscar's dashboard and API, which we modified for this customer. The talk may give an interesting view in large organisations' IT challenges, and how Oscar helps meeting these.
