:fulltitle: HitWizard - Predicting the future Hit Songs

The amount of data we collect these days from people listening to music is limitless and storing it is cheap. By applying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to the data, meaningful relations in this data can be found and utilised. 

To show how a large dataset of radio airplay can be put into meaning, HitWizard was developed by Goldmund, Wyldebeast & Wunderliebe in cooperation with RadioRadar. HitWizard uses past radio airplay in order to predict the hits of next week, validating its results against the Spotify top 200 charts. It uses the python toolkit Scikit Learn for preprocessing and classification of the data.

This talk will cover some basics of neural networks and classification, in combination with showing how this can be applied to predicting hit songs.
