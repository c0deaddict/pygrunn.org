Introduction to Elasticsearch, with sprinkles of Python

Elasticsearch helps search and analyze document sets of up to several billion documents, with responses measured in the tens of milliseconds or less. Elasticsearch provides a REST-based, JSON-oriented API for managing the data and managing the servers themselves. The servers scale out horizontally. A new server can be installed in 10 minutes, and additional nodes are just as easy to add.

This hands on demo, provides a technical introduction to Elasticsearch. We will start with demonstrating it's analytical powers through the lens of Kibana 4 - an open source data visualization platform built on top of Elasticsearch. Next, will leave the humanly appealing charts of Kibana and move to the REST API, built for machine consumption. As PyGrunn is about Python, we will also spend some time at looking the official Python client and use it to load some data into an Elasticsearch instance we will setup on the spot. Finally, we will use Marvel - an Elasticsearch based monitoring tool for, well, Elasticsearch. Through Marvel, we will see how a cluster responds to adding & removing nodes, distributing data as resources becomes available.
