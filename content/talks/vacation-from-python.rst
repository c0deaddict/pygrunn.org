:fulltitle: Vacation from Python

I've been writing Python professionally for 6 years straight and then just... stopped. Not that I didn't love Python, in fact quite the opposite, but I felt that I've exercised its limits. I haven't written a project in Python for almost 3 years after that, concentrating on Clojure and other JVM-based languages. Since about 3 months now I'm writing Python daily again and while it hasn't been hassle-free it's definitely a pleasant experience overall.

This talks tries to explore the reasons, both technical and less so that led me to quit Python, the things I've missed from Python in other languages and features or rather approach Python would benefit from. This is an opinionated talk, of course so expect a few eyebrow-raising sentences.
