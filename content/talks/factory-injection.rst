:fulltitle: Factory injection: Combining PyTest and FactoryBoy best practices in testing

This talk is an introduction to a new library pytest-factoryboy which I wrote and it is not well known yet, but important in my opinion.  I want to increase popularity of FactoryBoy and PyTest, explain the benefits of their patterns over traditional test suites and their tools. And the most important to demonstrate Python possibilities of introspection that allow you to avoid writing code, come up with the conventions that would automate the most annoying parts of the system like tests.
