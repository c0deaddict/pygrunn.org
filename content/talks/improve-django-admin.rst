The django admin is a much-loved killer feature of django. With two lines, you can add one of your own database models to the admin so that you can edit your data. But.... the admin can do so much more for you with a little extra configuration. A full-text search field for your objects only takes one line!  The django documentation (of course) explains it all, but if you come to my talk, I'll show you what is possible. Then you'll know what to look for in the documentation. With one or two hours work you can get VERY happy users or colleagues. Lots of happiness for relatively little work!
