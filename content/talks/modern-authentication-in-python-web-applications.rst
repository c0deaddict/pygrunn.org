:fulltitle: Modern authentication in Python web applications

The talk consists of two parts: (1) Single Sign-on and (2) Two-step verification (two-factor authentication).

(1) Standalone applications can handle their own user base and the authentication pretty well. When it comes to corporate solutions, itâ€™s not uncommon to use multiple applications. While from the developer perspective it may be just fine to log into 10 different environments in order to be able to work, from the end-user perspective multiple logins are quite annoying. Single Sign-on solves the problem.

(2) Stolen passwords are not uncommon these days. Two-step verification puts an extra layer of security over the standard login/password authentication.
