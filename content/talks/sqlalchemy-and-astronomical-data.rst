:fulltitle: SQLAlchemy and astronomical data

At the Anton Pannekoek institute we store a lot of data coming from the LOFAR radio telescope. This data is then later on processed for finding transients, objects that change over time. For storing and querying the data we use good old SQL. Although SQL does the job well, the language is quite outdated. It is a hard and challenging task to write and maintain complex queries. My talk will be about how we use Python and SQLAlchemy as tools for writing and managing complex astronomical queries.
