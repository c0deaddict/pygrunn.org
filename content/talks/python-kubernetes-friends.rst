:fulltitle: Python, Kubernetes and friends

Containers are the past, orchestration of containers is the future. In this talk you are going to learn the basic definitions that you will find in a Kubernetes cluster and how to deploy your Python applications there.

You are going to move your app from running it in a simple container to do a rolling-update in several machines and with 0 downtime.

Don't be scared, there will be loads of examples that will help to understand the abstractions that people from Kubernetes came up with.
