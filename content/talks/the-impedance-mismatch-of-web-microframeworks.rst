:title: The impedance mismatch of Web Microframeworks
:fulltitle: The impedance mismatch of Web Microframeworks

I love Web microframeworks, but most of them do HTTP routing wrong, because their core paradigm is at odds with that of the web. I’ll show examples using Bottle, Sinatra, Express, and Compojure to demonstrate that their approach to routing encourages developers to incorrectly implement HTTP and to misunderstand it; why this matters, and how to do it better, including a tiny library I’ve created for doing it right with Clojure and Compojure.
