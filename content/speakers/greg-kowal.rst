:name: Grzegorz "Greg" Kowal


I'm Polish, educated in Australia and living in Netherlands. I have strong background in Java, specially in web based solutions. I worked for different organisations including banks, telecom companies and small startups. Since 2010 I have been involved in developing Python and GIS (Geographical Information System) solutions. This became my passion. I have lovely wife Joanna and I'm a father of a 2 year old boy - Jan. You can always talk to me about history and cars - those are my other hobbies.
