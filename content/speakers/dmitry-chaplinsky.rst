I started to code with pen and paper when he was 11 and later won a few
CAD/CAM/CAE contests. I'm fascinated by artificial intelligence, natural
language processing, neural networks, arduino robotics, JavaScript and Python.

For the last 1.5 years I'm a part of Ukrainian NGO White Collar Hundred, where we developed a bunch of successful IT projects in the area of open data, transparency and anticorruption. All our projects are using python of course.

Here is a documentary about our effort: http://white-collar-hundred.docuspace.org/eng/
