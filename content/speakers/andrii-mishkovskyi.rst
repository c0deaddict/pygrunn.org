:name: Andrii Mishkovskyi

A funny bio where I describe my experience, making sure to list all my accomplishments and self-deprecatingly describe my current work. A reference to previous talks at various conferences. A reference to the proudest project, possibly impressive to general public. Small note about open-source contributions. Well-rounded last sentence.

P.S. A pun/joke.
