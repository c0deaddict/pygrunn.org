I'm a software allrounder who enjoys being active in the entire spectrum of software development. I love code, and also love all other things related to building software and products. I have been a developer, technical project manager, teamlead, product manager, requirements engineer and I currently am Head of Tech for Paylogic, where we are building the best ticketing system in the world.
