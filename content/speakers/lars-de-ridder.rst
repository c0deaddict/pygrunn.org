I'm a software allrounder who enjoys being active in the entire spectrum of software development. I love code, and also love all other things related to building software and products. I have been a developer, technical project manager, teamlead, product manager, requirements engineer and Head of Tech. Currently I am co-founder and technical guy at XIThing, where we build the Internet of Things.
