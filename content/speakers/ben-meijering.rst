After obtaining a PhD in Artificial Intelligence, and working in the Big Data industry, Iâ€™ve become a freelance data scientist. I do consultancy, and build machine learning products.

One day, I hope to apply my skills in the gaming industry, where sensors, motion controllers, and AR/VR headsets will produce tremendous amounts of streaming data.
