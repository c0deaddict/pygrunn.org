I'm experienced Plone developer with background of RDBMS development and report building. I was involved in big implementations of ERP systems, where my main task were building reports with SQL and Crystal Reports, and writing Intranet applications. Since 2013 working with Goldmund, Wyldebeast & Wunderliebe as senior Plone developer.
