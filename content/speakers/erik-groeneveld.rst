Erik has a broad background in programming languages but stuck to Python for most of 
his professional work.

He pushes every language to its limits.  You ca find work of him implementing true delegation
in Java for example.  Delegation in Python work out much better though, see 
https://github.com/ejgroene/huecycle/blob/master/huecycle/prototype.py.

Python Generators turned his world inside-out since the very beginning. He writes complete
inverted programs using generators only.
