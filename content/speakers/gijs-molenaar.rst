When I was a kid I wanted to become a bicycle repair man. Now I'm working at the Anton Pannekoek Institute as a scientific software engineer for the AARTFAAC project, which is also fun. Although I'm living in Amsterdam this year I'll be a lot in South Africa working on software for the Square Kilometre Array. In my spare time I make beer and music.
