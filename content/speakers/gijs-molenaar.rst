When I was a kid I wanted to become a bicycle repair man. Now I'm working at the University of Amsterdam as a scientific software engineer on software for the LOFAR telescope, which is also fun. At the same time I'm doing a PhD on data reduction pipelines for the SKA telescope in South Africa. I have a MSc in Artificial Intelligence but accidentally ended up in radio astronomy. In my spare time I make craft beer and music.
