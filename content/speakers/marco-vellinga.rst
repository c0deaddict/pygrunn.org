Hi I'm Marco Vellinga a 25 year old programmer at Devhouse Spindle.

At Devhouse Spindle we have two main product which are VoIPGRID and Lily. I'm mainly focused on VoIPGRID which is written in Python and Django. I have a passion for security which is also incorporated in my day to day business.

When I'm not on the job I like to ride my motorbike and do some freelance work. Like every other programmer I have a 'few' unfinished project laying around which also consume time.
