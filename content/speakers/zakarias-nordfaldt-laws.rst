I came from Sweden 3 years ago to study Computer Science at Vrije Universiteit, where I recently graduated. I am now working at Goldmund, Wyldebeast & Wunderliebe, a software development company with offices in Groningen and Amsterdam. 

My favorite topics within Computer Science are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and big data. Other than that I also develop websites and mobile applications. In my spare time I try to go paragliding and traveling as much as possible.
