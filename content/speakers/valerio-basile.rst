I'm currently a 4th year PhD student at RUG in Computational Linguistics, but in the past have worked with databases, system administration, Web dev and a bunch of other stuff. I was even a PC salesman at some point and a Computer Science student in Bologna.

I've seen both worlds of industry and academia and I haven't decided yet what's best for me. I'm a Free Software enthusiast and a Python aficionado. When I grow up I want to be an inventor.
