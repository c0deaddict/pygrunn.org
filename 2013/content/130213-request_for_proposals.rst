We are currently in the process of constructing the `talk schedule  <pages/schedule.html>`_ for PyGrunn 2013. We already have number of excellent speakers and topics, but there are some slots still open. If you have a subject that you think will keep the critical PyGrunn audience on the edge of their seats for half an hour than let us know using the `Request for Proposals <pages/rfp.html>`_ form. The submission deadline is April 15th 12:00.
