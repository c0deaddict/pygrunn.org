Ladies and gentlemen, we've got him! After trying for a few years we are happy to announce that this year's keynote speaker will be `Holger Krekel <http://holgerkrekel.net/>`_. Among many other things Holger Krekel is the founder and co-developer of PyPy, and the sole author of the wonderful `pytest <http://pytest.org/>`_ and `tox <http://tox.testrun.org/>`_ testing tools. Combined with a love for test- and documentation-driven software development, Holger is bound to be an excellent keynote speaker for PyGrunn.
