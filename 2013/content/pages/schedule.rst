Berco Beute: REST API design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The web has proven that REST is a winning architecture for large, loosely coupled distributed systems. But building proper REST APIs is harder than it seems at first glance. It not only requires the right toolset but most importantly a good understanding of the ideas behind REST. In this high-pace talk Berco Beute will run you through all aspects and highlight those where Python can really help you out.

Bio:
CTO, hacker, musician and all-round internet technology enthusiast Berco Beute has been inspired by the possibilities of software since the eithies. His enthusiasm show no signs of decline. Au contraire.

Jan-Jaap Driessen: Fantastic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`Fanstatic <http://www.fanstatic.org/en/latest/>`_ is a small but powerful framework for the automatic publication of resources on a web page. Think Javascript and CSS. It just serves static content, but it does it really well.

Bio Jan-Jaap:
Been working with python for a long time. Contributor to Grok and Fanstatic. Full-stack engineer at Minddistrict, changing the future of health care one commit at a time.

Alex Gonzalez
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Apache brings them the peace pipe. This pipe is called Thrift. With Thrift you can communicate distributed services. Let's say that the functionality is similar to RESTful APIs but there are some big differences that perhaps can be interesting for your next project."

Bio:
My name is Alexandre González, I am a 29 years old Spanish developer currently working in UK, exactly in London at GreenManGaming. Last year I was working in Groningen, with my ex-colleagues of Paylogic. I usually try to work on backend and mainly with Python but since few months I am starting to make some small changes to our Scala codebase but I am just a beginner. Intregration between services is my dream and my nightmare at the same time.

Daniel & Gideon de Kok: What Python can learn from Haskell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MapReduce wasn't invented by Google, queues maybe aren't the best tools for realtime processing and OO languages are starting to be less valuable in the modern age. In this talk we're going to show what the fuzz on functional programming is about, how functional concepts and Haskell can help to solve complex problems in the ""Big Data"" era and how these same principles can be used in realtime processing of large data streams.

Bio Daniel:
Daniël loves to discover patterns in data using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. He has experience with parsing and generation of human language, constructing classification models for huge data sets, and building user-friendly interfaces for analyzing data.

Bio Gideon:
Gideon has a background in both infrastructures as (mobile) software design and engineering. Generally spends his days searching for solutions in performance and reliability problems with a functional, pragmatic approach."

Holger Krekel: re-inventing Python packaging & testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Python still does not have a built-in installer that can install dependencies.  You have to install setuptools/distribute and easy_install/pip to use it.  Installation of packages is slow and depends on reachability of the pypi and other servers.  There is no quality control where you could e. g. see on which platforms the package successfully installs, let alone has automated tests passing.  There is not even a standard way to run tests.  This talk discusses currently ongoing PEPs and enhancements to the situation and also showcases
a new caching PyPI service which speeds up installation by an order of magnitude.

Bio:
When i discovered Python i was thrilled by its high-level constructs and introspection facilities. I am still thrilled by the idea of dynamically deploying and executing high level programs in the net. In my view, Python and testing are a wonderfully productive combination for writing software. Out of this conviction, I founded and co-developed the PyPy project and maintain the pytest and tox testing tools.

Emil Loer: Python raytracing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Raytracing is a technique for creating visually realistic images by tracing the path of light as it bounces around the environment. By tracing the light we can get many spectacular effects such as shadows, reflections and refraction. In my talk I am going to show you how to build a tracer using Python so you can impress your friends with pretty pictures.

Bio:
Emil Loer is a developer, entrepreneur and jazz musician. He is the co-owner and technical visionary of BarTune, a company that delivers interactive music players to pubs and restaurants. Emil has deep knowledge on software synthesis, signal processing and real-time computing. He is a profound Vim evangelist and an advocate of test driven development.

Douwe van der Meij & Brandon Tilstra: MVC revisited with Diazo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our talk will be about Diazo. First a general introduction and later a "live" demo about our Python generic in-house created theme editor, based on the Plone theme editor.

Bio Douwe:
Senior Python developer and Scrum master at GW20e. Model Driven Engineering fanatic, Django enthusiast and Diazo evangelist.

Bio Brandon:
Student Computer Science at Hanzehogeschool Groningen. Intern at GW20e focussed on developing a Python generic Diazo theme editor."

Gijs Molenaar: LOFAR <3 Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LOFAR, the Low Frequency Array, is a new radio telescope constructed across Northern Europe which has recently started science operations. One of its key science goals is to detect and, where appropriate, respond to transient astronomical phenomena – such as supernovae and gamma ray bursts – as they happen. However, identifying these transients in the multi-terabyte LOFAR data stream is complex, and making the results easily accessible to astronomers is hard. I will describe the automatic transient identification systems we have put in place and how we use Python to make this possible.

Bio:
software composer, music brewer, beer programmer.

Alessandro Molina: High Performance Web Applications with Python and TurboGears
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Users are getting more and more used to fast websites, a second or two is way too much before they leave the page. Since version 2.2 TurboGears has focused on providing more tools to create faster web applications and improving its speed constantly. The latest 2.3 version, the first to support Python3 is up to 4x faster than the previous and provides a great toolset to make fast pages. The talk will focus on showcasing the tools provided by the framework to increase speed of your web applications and provide some tips and tricks to get maximum speed from the framework itself. Last part of the talk will also cover the TurboGears minimal mode for single page web applications providing a comparison with server generated templates.

Bio:
Python developer since 2001 has always been interested in Python as a Web Development Platform, he is currently a core developer of the TurboGears2 framework in charge of the Python3 support branch and has collaborated with various python projects related to web development like FormEncode, ToscaWidgets, the Sprox Widget Generation Library and the Ming MongoDB ORM

Kenneth Reitz: Python for humans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Python's ecosystem is held up to a high standard, but it falls short in a few key areas. A handful of crucial APIs are an absolute pain to work with. We’ll go over where these APIs went wrong and learn about strong and elegant API design. The high barriers to entry in Python will be discussed. Potential solutions will be proposed.

Luuk van der Velden: best practices for the lone coder syndrome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Scientists (especially PhD-students) are often isolated by their management, to work on their own project. In addition the research is so specialized that lots of new code has to be written. The problem is that this code will have to last for the entire project (4 years), and preferably after that, and thus will have to withstand code rot and manifest readability, proper documentation, extensibility and maintainability. The fact that one person has to set these high standards for the code that most likely only he will use, is a psychological problem, which I dub the lone coder syndrome. In this talk I will share experiences and talk about the best practices I have adopted from mainstream development methods to keep my code healthy.

Bio:
