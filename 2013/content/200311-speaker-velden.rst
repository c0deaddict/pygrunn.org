It's our pleasure to announce Luuk van der Velden as a confirmed speaker for PyGrunn 2013.

Luuk is a neuroscience PhD student, webdeveloper and drummer. This in combination with an interest in electronic music started his programming activities. Luuk has some years of experience in matlab, but happily switched to python for his PhD endeavour. The abstract of Luuk's talk is: "Scientists (especially PhD-students) are often isolated by their management, to work on their own project. In addition the research is so specialized that lots of new code has to be written. The problem is that this code will have to last for the entire project (4 years), and preferably after that, and thus will have to withstand code rot and manifest readability, proper documentation, extensibility and maintainability. The fact that one person has to set these high standards for the code that most likely only he will use, is a psychological problem, which I dub the lone coder syndrome. In this talk I will share experiences and talk about the best practices I have adopted from mainstream development methods to keep my code healthy."
