Welcome to the improved PyGrunn Conference site. We added an initial list of confirmed speakers, a call for proposals and a schedule. To participate in the community join `the PyGrunn google+ community <https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/100366363140062149195>`_. 

On a technical note: We turned the site into a static site so it can be served from Amazon S3. No more need to run a webserver, we weren't serving static content anyway. We used Pelican to create a static site.
