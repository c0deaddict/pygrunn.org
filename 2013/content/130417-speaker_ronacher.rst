We are particularly proud to welcome a long-term friend at PyGrunn 2013: `Armin Ronacher <http://lucumr.pocoo.org/>`_! Armin's star has been rising deservedly within the Python community over the past years. His impressive work on Flask, Jinja and Werkzeug (just to name a few) make Armin an excellent speaker or PyGrunn. This year Armin will talk about his experiences with MongoDB. We are looking forward to that!
