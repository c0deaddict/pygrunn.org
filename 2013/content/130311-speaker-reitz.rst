The abstract of Kenneth's talk is: "Python’s ecosystem is held up to a high standard, but it falls short in a few key areas. A handful of crucial APIs are an absolute pain to work with. We’ll go over where these APIs went wrong and learn about strong and elegant API design. The high barriers to entry in Python will be discussed. Potential solutions will be proposed."
