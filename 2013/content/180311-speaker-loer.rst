Emil has deep knowledge on software synthesis, signal processing and real-time computing. He is a profound Vim evangelist and an advocate of test driven development. The abstract of his talk is: "Raytracing is a technique for creating visually realistic images by tracing the path of light as it bounces around the environment. By tracing the light we can get many spectacular effects such as shadows, reflections and refraction. In my talk I am going to show you how to build a tracer using Python so you can impress your friends with pretty pictures."
